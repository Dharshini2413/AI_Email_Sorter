AI_Email_Sorter is a tool to read, summarize and categorize emails. 
Python is used which consumes imap to access email, Gemini API to summarize/categorize emails, streamlit to display the emails.
Currently, gmail is accessed with app password and streamlit UI dashboard is hosted locally.
This will be scaled to include OAuth for accessing gmails and Render(probably) to display emails.
